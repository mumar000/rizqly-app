Mobile App + Desktop Dashboard (Different Designs, Same Brand)

Design a Gen-Z personal finance & expense management product with two separate experiences:

Mobile App → primary product

Desktop Dashboard → secondary, power view

Both should share brand identity but NOT the same layout or UX.

🎯 Target User

Gen Z (18–28)
Mobile-first behavior
Checks phone daily
Uses desktop occasionally for clarity, review, and planning

📱 MOBILE APP DESIGN (Primary)

Role
Fast, emotional, addictive
Daily check-ins
Quick expense capture

Vibe
Lifestyle app, not fintech
Clean, playful, aesthetic
Dark mode first
Soft gradients, subtle glow, glass cards

UX Rules
Thumb-first navigation
One-hand usage
Zero friction
Everything within 2 taps

Key Screens

Onboarding → swipe based, no forms

Home → big balance card, spend rings, weekly snapshot

Add Expense → floating action button, emoji categories

Insights → simple visuals, friendly copy

Goals → progress bars, animations, “level up” feel

Visual Style
Rounded cards
Big numbers
Small labels
Icons > text
Micro-animations on every interaction

🖥️ DESKTOP DASHBOARD (Secondary)

Role
Clarity, overview, control
Not for daily use
For reviewing patterns and planning

Vibe
Calm, premium, minimal
More data, still clean
No clutter, no spreadsheets

UX Rules
More breathing space
Clear hierarchy
Side navigation or top nav
Information grouped logically

Key Sections

Monthly overview with charts

Category breakdown (visual, not tables)

Trends over time

Editable expense list (only place with rows)

Goals + progress in one view

Visual Style
Wider layouts
Lighter gradients
Subtle motion (not flashy)
Typography-led hierarchy

🔗 BRAND CONSISTENCY (IMPORTANT)

Same:

Color palette

Typography

Icon style

Tone of voice

Different:

Layouts

Navigation patterns

Interaction density

Mobile = emotional + fast
Desktop = analytical + calm

🧠 DESIGN PHILOSOPHY

Mobile feels like:
A daily money companion

Desktop feels like:
A clean command center

Never:

Old-school finance UI

Heavy tables everywhere

Corporate dashboards

Use Nextjs+supabase for database and other thigns and in the end include tutorial file also how to use supabase in this

don't compromise on design

design should be genz modern addictive to use
